It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!

As you may know, most Spider Solitaire games are not winnable even though you play your best. That's where we come in. We included in this game only winnable deals for all types of games: with one suit, with 2 suits and 4 suits. Thus you can be sure that you will win if you play perfectly. Now you can truly enjoy the game. \r\nDownload and have fun playing Spider Solitaire Mobile!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Solvable deals that have at least one winning solution\r\n✓ 1 suit, 2 suits and 4 suits games\r\n✓ Advanced Hint option\r\n✓ Unlimited Undo\r\n✓ Drag-and-drop or Tap to move cards\r\n✓ Unmovable cards will be greyed out\r\n✓ Nice sound effects and music\r\n✓ Daily/monthly/all time highscores\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ HOW TO PLAY ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ The goal of the game is to create sets of cards that start with a king, queen and jack and end with an ace. Completed sets of cards will be automatically removed from the board and you score points. In order to win you have to remove all the cards from the board.\r\n✓ Drag-and-drop cards or simply tap on the cards to move them on an eligible column.\r\n✓ In games with more than one suit, in order for a set to be complete, all the cards in that column need to be in order and of the same suit. When you are successful in building a set, these will be automatically removed from the board. \r\n✓ You are allowed to mix different suits as long as the cards are in a descending order. But you cannot move the stacks, unless they're of the same suit.\r\n✓ If you ever get empty columns you can place any card or any stack there.\r\n✓ When you run out of useful moves, tap on the stock pile at the bottom of the screen to be dealt a new row of cards.\r\n✓ You can only deal a new row of cards when all the columns are filled. Place at least one card on every column to be allowed to be dealt new rows of cards.\r\n✓ By default the set number of suits is 2. But you can change it from the main menu. To enter the main menu and to also pause the game just press on the button in the top left corner of the screen. You can change the number of suits from 2 to 4, from 4 to 1 and from 1 to 2. The changes take effect when you start a new game. \r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

Afrofuturism theme, set 3000 years into the future. The overall game premise follows the exploits of future bounty hunters who take on extremely risky and clandestine missions on behalf of Mega corporations; corporations who don’t want to be seen as dealing in the grey and black markets.\r\n\r\nBOAA features a Solo Progression Mode, an Arcade mode (offline or online) and a Multiplayer* mode (up to 4 players).\r\n\r\nThe action takes place in battle arenas. These battle arenas are, in fact, organized tournaments that Mega Corporations use to scout the next best bounty hunters. It is also the future of entertainment sports, having upended our modern day (circa 2000) sports events, several centuries prior (circa 3000). Participants in these battle arenas partake in the fray in order to acquire as much Cowries as possible (the preferred means of monetary instrument amongst bounty hunters).  In the real world, Cowries are Digital Tokens* that players can use to acquire unique digitally signed game items (CryptoCollectables*).\r\n\r\nThe game mechanics of BOAA is simple: you can either jump or shoot (but can't do both at the same time). Survival is the order of the day. So what is it going to be… Jump Or Shoot?\r\n\r\n*This Tech Demo will be showcasing the different game mechanics and game modes progressively with each update.

“Colouring”.\r\n \r\nThe “Triplets” game helps understand and memorize addition and subtraction within ten. The child is given three digits and two operators and has to compose the case him/herself.\r\nWhat’s so special about it? The child visually memorizes the case itself and can see what will happen if he changes the digits. Now there is no need to scissor out paper digits. The program itself indicates whether or not your child has composed the case right.\r\n \r\n“Training” is an easy-to-handle tool for effective instruction of your child. Forget about countless slips of paper with cases written on them! Everything is right here: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. After solving the problem the results are saved and can be seen on the stats page, the graph represents the results and the number of errors. This helps to track the dynamics of learning.\r\n \r\nOnce your child has learnt to solve the cases, you won’t have to study with him.

Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games. Use menu (top-tight corner) to change the game type, difficulty, check score, help or to start a new game.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDM822","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Puzzle Craft","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7411.9007199266447233.48518232-d1f0-4089-9d76-ec855f66bc21.9f05e1eb-142f-47fa-82a4-03e7cb24a5f0","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2681.9007199266447233.cc07b5e6-8c81-42c2-b209-8a1d69d558b8.fe949171-9e5f-416c-98b3-9499fd4eeca3","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["0BCF39DC.PuzzleCraft_7r58kgx22y7jj"],"ContentIds":["3c3cc9e7-37b5-92d3-bc07-47c0c5bf5016"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Some villagers have started a new settlement and they've put you in charge.
