In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference. Always try to smash rivals in the side of their vehicle or from the rear. Head-on collisions on the other hand should be avoided. Practice makes perfect!\r\n\r\nUpgrades:\r\nYou have various cars you can unlock. These all have the pros and cons. Be sure to upgrade your cars wisely as the various type of events require different cars. Use armor upgrades to strengthen your endurance; or engine upgrades to boost your speed. To get your upgrades you earn money during races. The better you perform the more you earn. Before a race you can also buy power-ups to boost your performance during a race. The nitro boost will allow you to accelerate super-fast and smash your opponents even harder; or choose one of the other power-ups such an armor booster to strengthen your car during the race. \r\n\r\nIf you like demolition games this game is made for you!\r\n3, 2, 1 start your download and join the ultimate demolition derby game experience now!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDRPRX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spider Solitaire X","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27892.9007199266567277.a81e9507-4f6c-444e-8ee6-743c7ca70323.cce0a931-b7d4-41be-8d26-0432d8d2d597","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61468.9007199266567277.45bdf841-86b6-46bb-8de6-18fbe50539dc.6b33438c-d66b-4b34-97f5-52d4732752cc","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["10867XAppsStudio.SpiderSolitaireX_9x90rfe02k9we"],"ContentIds":["d8d8ff59-ad83-e1f7-183c-6042cc68a3dc","dd7065d6-febc-12cf-d875-91fd5fe873ca","8d03ca2b-ba3b-1a37-d469-897797ba81d7"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Best spider solitaire game.

Each stack must start with an Ace, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and end with a King. \r\n✓ At the beginning of the game, all the cards are dealt into 8 columns. At the top of the screen you will find 4 free cells and 4 foundations. Use the free cells to temporarily store one card at a time during the game.\r\n✓ Once you place a card in the foundation you cannot take it back. Make sure you no longer need it before placing it there.\r\n✓ You can move a card from one column to another if the top card from the other column is +1 higher and is of a different color. For example, you can put a 3 of hearts over a 4 of spades. Or you can put a 10 of clubs over a Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓ You can move an entire series of cards if you have enough free positions. Empty columns and empty free cells are considered free positions. The series of cards must be smaller or equal than the number of free positions plus 1. For example, if you have 2 empty free cells and one empty column you can move at most 4 cards at a time.\r\n✓ If you cannot move a stack because it is too large you can try splitting it into two parts. Then you can reassemble it in a new column.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

Make sure you drive straight and don’t crash into buildings as that will stop you from reaching the hospital in time and can also be fatal for the patients.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6HM2S","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Ankle Surgery Simulator","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1846.13510798886724943.b919e963-48cb-44cb-bc60-5922e0b764f5.c039d8bf-cbf0-43e6-8edd-b39c668e41ef","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62313.13510798886724943.7c6016fc-0b5f-4f6f-b4f2-f622efbb2fc0.528f6c3c-4689-41d1-8370-ab431700d5dd","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10243.13510798886724943.7807e64b-9470-4893-98de-2bb3c0ce839d.1264c4c8-f011-40b4-adfa-010b51a2d2ef","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32353.13510798886724943.e4921e97-7794-46a7-8a68-b09e1e2f3727.22065fd6-013b-4d17-8264-017e46361cb2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["6419VinegarGames.AnkleSurgerySimulator_zccq09qmxe4qc"],"ContentIds":["bc3ffe68-d56f-458b-d8b0-ecc6fa2e5c95"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"BE WARNED!

Each stack must start with an Ace, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and end with a King.\r\n✓ At the beginning of the game, all the cards are dealt into 8 columns. At the top of the screen you will find 4 free cells and 4 foundations. Use the free cells to temporarily store one card at a time during the game.\r\n✓ Once you place a card in the foundation you cannot take it back. Make sure you no longer need it before placing it there.\r\n✓ You can move a card from one column to another if the top card from the other column is +1 higher and is of a different color. For example, you can put a 3 of hearts over a 4 of spades. Or you can put a 10 of clubs over a Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓ You can move an entire series of cards if you have enough free positions. Empty columns and empty free cells are considered free positions. The series of cards must be smaller or equal than the number of free positions plus 1. For example, if you have 2 empty free cells and one empty column you can move at most 4 cards at a time.\r\n✓ If you cannot move a stack because it is too large you can try splitting it into two parts. Then you can reassemble it in a new column.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board.

This annual event has become a drawing card for treasure hunters from all over the town, where everyone can benefit as both a buyer and a seller.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that this garage sale is one of the most successful in the country. Karen, Sarah and Thomas are customers at our neighborhood garage sale. Consistently finding the good stuff at yard sales is their mission. Like any mission, it requires strategy. They have prepared themselves how to choose their target, plan their attack, assemble the necessary gear, and get in and out fast. They even made a map which lists locations and categories of what is being sold at each location.\r\n\r\nNow they are starting their search around the site for shopping and bargaining. A bargain is almost guaranteed on garage sales.

Fly airplane, sail big ferry & drive cars into the ship. A classic simulation game with airplane flying, car diving, ship sailing and cargo transport tasks. A whole new environment with exotic City, docks and airport for airplane flight and landings. A transporter game to load and transport cargo to destinations with road, air and sea travelling. Fly over the blue water and travel to different cities to transport goods through your cargo plane. Driving on roads might be an easy task but airplane flight is not easy to handle. The objective of the game is all about transportation. Deploy your vehicles for multiple tasks and build your transport industry as a transportation city contractor.\r\n\r\nThe transport story begins with car driving inside the city and reaching the docks where you will park the cars inside the cruise ship, taking the cargo later to the other island. Some tasks would feature airplane flight to transport cars and luggage to the other cities. Operate heavy cranes to lift containers into the big trucks. Truck driving is also an important part of the game with airport transport and transportation inside the city as well.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5LGTN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Ball Color Switch","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57539.13510798887179517.49c76e8c-e89b-4906-9971-0fb4d22b880a.fc0214e2-b0be-40e9-b10b-37632f1f2cd1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24245.13510798887179517.765becde-e083-4b02-a0c8-828535c0b40e.77fe73fd-cc05-41f3-8ec0-e95968b14ecc","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37124.13510798887179517.aed2d727-9cd1-4b4f-845c-c7b76e0f5c03.cbf358eb-fba2-4686-b672-1a25181c2e22","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45446.13510798887179517.4e3d07a4-bc66-4ed0-847f-51ba5bbe2ce5.95c1da38-2e6e-4380-9d36-65159f6cad66","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["40517HUTStudio.BallColorSwitch_5z9e7j7fdynx6"],"ContentIds":["b0aefa4f-3eab-4a17-7cb3-e423ba5d2d5f","b251faf8-4c54-b081-317b-a2e0fa0f05cf"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Tap to jump the ball carefully through each obstacle and your ball will switch color with some power ups. 70 new balls. 650 new levels, 08 game modes for Color Switch: Racing, Split, Color Swap, Color Fly, Challenge, Reverse, Cave, Normal.

It uses unique spatial audio cues to signal to the player where they are in the play-space and where the main game object, the ball, is traveling.\r\n\r\nThe player controls a paddle from the first-person perspective. They can hear and/or see the ball traveling around the court, which is at eye level. The goal of the game is to hit the ball back and forth with a partner or computer player until one player misses the ball with their paddle; this scores a point for the other player. With each hit, the ball speeds up slightly, adding an extra layer of challenge and excitement. The first player to score seven points wins the match.\r\n\r\nAudio feedback:\r\nBall audio – A fine-tuned combination of low-frequency humming and high-frequency ticking, along with other contextual sound effects, makes the ball easy to locate with audio alone\r\nPlayer location cues – Unique sounds indicating the side walls and center point of the court let the player know where they are at all times\r\nOpponent feedback – Similar “paddle impact” sounds play for both the player and their opponent, indicating when and where the opponent has hit the ball","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PPD1KP95G7F","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bingo Stars","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41071.14331203952011896.481a259d-ee7d-454f-9f4f-95cf04db4b13.a7a8e04b-4186-4907-8a01-a30409e528a8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14981.14331203952011896.a7be6119-333b-4760-98cf-79e585fdae84.0bd15fee-1583-4666-9c4c-a6c96d1a947e","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24643.14331203952011896.585307e0-b46e-4759-927f-f14f7da70660.5930667a-30ce-43b5-93b1-728d4c38bfe7","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["44206SilentMonkGames.BingoStars_9nr9yt7wn1prj"],"ContentIds":["5aa0ca7b-4af7-fa69-4c2e-e816bd5f99eb","58c6715c-6e1c-14dc-d797-28845af74582"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The Best Classic Bingo Game is here!

Board pieces move based on dice throws.\r\n\r\nThis is a game of skill. A single game can be decided by luck, but the more one plays, the more the skill is important. After ~30 games the true skill emerges. Even a beginner can beat an expert through luck of draw in a single game, but after several games the skill prevails.\r\n\r\nThis version of Backgammon uses an advanced neural network in the highest levels, and will challenge advanced players. It also offers a fun experience for beginners, with lower difficulty levels and showing possible moves.\r\n\r\nThe scoring is based on the official Backgammon ELO system, with each game increasing or reducing rating points every game or match.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n=========\r\n* Worldwide online high scores\r\n* Play a Trial Game, or a Scored Game that counts towards your score\r\n* High res graphic board\r\n* Dice statistics history\r\n* Real time probability calculation\r\n* Achievements\r\n* Tutorials\r\n* 4 difficulty levels: easy to hard\r\n* 1 or 2 player mode\r\n* Many options:\r\n    -

This is absolute madness as the block has been turned into a dead zone jungle. It is time to defend national pride and bring in the big guns. This invasion calls for direct action!\r\n\r\nIt is up to heroic little you to defend the neighbourhood. In this epic turret defence game you are building an army of block defenders with unique skills. You will need to use your fantasy and imagination to conquer the Blockheads once and for all!\r\n\r\nPOWERFUL WEAPONS\r\nLuckily you have some toys to your disposal that can push back the alien invasion.\r\n\r\nBouncer:\r\nBouncers throw tiny bombs that do quite some splash damage. Cheap to build, but has limited range and is best used in large numbers. Summoning bouncers is always a good idea!\r\n\r\nSniper:\r\nShoots enemies from a great distance with a powerful shot. This tower unit has a very wide range and can easily snipe baddies from a far. Unfortunately the sniper does need quite some time to reload itself, but it remains your strongest long range shooter.\r\n\r\nFan:\r\nThe fan unit is not developed to provide a cool breeze in the heat of battle. Instead this fan is very powerful and slows down the approaching army of enemies with a sonic blast. Your other units can then take time and annihilate the competition! Range is quite limited so it is best to place this unit at junctions and close to your other towers.\r\n\r\nTesla turret:\r\nEvery strategy game needs a tesla coil right? This is the most powerful of your units, but also one of the most expensive. It has good range and does a lot of damage. Reload time is relatively quick and it fries enemies with a powerful electrical laser. This is hell-fire of the highest order!\r\n\r\nTurbolaser (from a certain galaxy):\r\nIn later levels you will need this powerful anti air unit as it is the only Block Defender that can shoot flying enemy types. Its X - ray range is limited and you will most likely need a couple of these to counter incoming squadrons. Luckily they are relatively cheap to produce. It can not defend against ground based targets.\r\n\r\nECONOMICS\r\nThese weapons should be sufficient and up to the task. The biggest challenge however, especially in later levels are your economics. You will find that you might need to sell units on the fly in order to purchase new ones. Robots and Blockheads are relentless in their march and it is key to pay attention to where the threat is coming from and what the best counter measures are!\r\n\r\nIn short Block Defender offers a real challenge and with episode unlocks there is always something new just around the corner. And you know what they say - a strategy game a day keeps the brain doctor away!\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n+ 3 worlds to conquer\r\n+ 30 challenging levels to complete\r\n+ Defend against land, sea and air units \r\n+ 5 powerful units to master (4 ground / 1 air)\r\n+ Many different enemy types to defeat\r\n+ Lite or premium game-play\r\n+ Unique graphical style","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6HQ1G","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fly Transporter: Airplane Pilot","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44591.13510798886727659.acc9602b-d8e6-4ec0-a3cc-e82c9875691a.f83e52f3-ee11-468c-81dd-ea6654fd89c7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17159.13510798886727659.2aec9337-17b6-4fab-b35a-4fe4c534c8b5.a2b9a415-ca77-4c1c-8632-16a4572aced1","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51255.13510798886727659.587860d3-791a-4b38-b95a-8ffdf6a601a5.ff0f7b47-46ec-4856-b128-211f0b3be217","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["26584MegaGamersProduction.FlyTransporterAirplanePi_4pqzn5y41beq4"],"ContentIds":["b7c9518f-1a7e-1bef-5119-d1fa70393ded","6b941f33-cd2e-3316-03bf-2415977c3d5a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Fly Transporter: Airplane Pilot: Takeoff transporter plane from airports with practice sessions.
