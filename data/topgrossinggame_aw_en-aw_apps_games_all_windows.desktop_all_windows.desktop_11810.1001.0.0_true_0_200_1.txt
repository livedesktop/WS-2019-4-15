It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!

NEW: AI Robot \"Pablo\" will walk you through the basics. \r\n\r\nTeleport around, explore the arena, have a conversation, or do a silly dance together. Once you are ready, join into the arena for a casual game. Simply guess what someone else is drawing or draw something for others to guess. \r\n\r\nFeeling energy for action? Try our multiplayer MR Paintball, splatter your friends or the arena with lovely colors. Remember to dodge and refill!\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Paint_Arena and share videos or screenshots of your best 3D paintings or MR paintball games with hashtag #Paint_Arena :)\r\n\r\nConceptualization: \r\nMany virtual reality games today are designed to enhance graphic intensity and immersion, but increasingly isolate the players. We believe Windows Mixed Reality can be much more than that. We decided to design a casual game that people of all ages can play, share, and socialize in mixed reality. We were inspired by a classic interactive puzzle game for friends and family, while we were amazed by the potential of the mixed reality motion controllers, so Paint Arena was born. Many thanks to Mixed Reality Academy for the paint brush example.  \r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\nYou will need a HoloLens or a WMR immersive headset with a mixed reality motion controllers (and headphones, if not Samsung Odyssey) to enjoy this experience.\r\n\r\nThis social experience is best enjoyed in a casual standing pose. If you feel you are not at the right height after app launch, simply stand up, look forward, and say or tap \"Reset Floor Level\". \r\n\r\nYou could draw and talk to others and guess each others' drawings. If you are the first one to join, you would be assigned the drawer for the first round. You would be given a random word. Draw something to help others guess the word (without drawing any letters or digits). Once someone guesses your word correctly, a guesser will chosen at random to become the drawer. \r\n\r\nToggle \"Painting On\" to \"Paint Balling\" to start shooting paintballs and splatter the arena. Each full tank contains 100 paintballs. Every 5 seconds, you can partially refill the tank with 20 paintballs by pressing \"Refill 20 Paintballs\" button or saying the voice command \"Refill Paint Ball\". Try to move around to dodge incoming paintballs, or teleport to reposition. Score by reducing others' health bars to zero, upon which they would enter ghost mode and respawn at a random location in 10 seconds. \r\n\r\nIn Immersive headsets: Make sure you set up boundary for all experiences before you begin. While \"Painting On\", once you see your robotic right hand holding a paint brush, you can press the right hand trigger button to start drawing. While \"Paint Balling\", you can aim with your right hand controller, and press right hand trigger to shoot paintballs.\r\n\r\nOnce you see your robotic left arm holding a motion controller, you can use the touch pad to select paint color. Alternatively, you can tap \"Pick Color\" to bring up the large color wheel. \r\n\r\nIf you made a mistake, you can say \"Erase Last Stroke\" or press right hand controller grab button. You can also clear all strokes by saying \"Erase All Strokes\". \r\n\r\nTo rotate your view, point the joysticks left or right on one of the motion controllers. \r\n\r\nTo teleport, make sure the panel shows \"Teleport On\". Then point your cursor at the floor with one of the motion controllers, and hold the joystick forward until a Teleport marker appears, then release the joystick. \r\n\r\nIn HoloLens, you can use gaze, tap gesture to select options on the menu in front of you (look below chest level). You can use the same voice commands as elaborated above. While \"Painting On\", you can reach your hand out in front of you, pinch and hold while dragging the paint brush along. While \"Paint Balling\", you can aim with your gaze and air tap to shoot paintballs.\r\n\r\nBefore teleporting in HoloLens, make sure the panel shows \"Teleport On\". Then you can use your gaze to aim, and then tap to dash across the map! You could also hide the Guessing Window and the Panel if they are blocking your gazes. Remember to turn off teleport before drawing or shooting. \r\n\r\n\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NH67ZGNBB6K","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Mr Gun 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54815.13631575279858874.aa9ca9bf-7c59-4f25-9a41-402279f40b3e.061f08ca-2f50-4e5b-874d-3a320120b872","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10377.13631575279858874.aa9ca9bf-7c59-4f25-9a41-402279f40b3e.e4806a8e-503d-4aab-952d-58e19f8f165e","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["44511HappyDragonInc.MrGun3D_ffz6r8qf25722"],"ContentIds":["85b3f6a7-7f85-823e-ff3c-2feb25020d98","4873747b-ced6-3c24-14a0-3cccadfa5ea4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Are you a good shot?

and consuming other players to gain mass to grow the largest and longest in the game. Once the player starts the game and is spawned into the virtual world, their avatar cannot stop moving forward. If the player's worm's head collides into a part of another worm, the player will die. The defeated avatar's body turns into bright, shining pellets for other players to consume. As much pellets as it takes for the equivalent amount of mass as the worm had exactly before its death will be transmuted. These pellets that remain from \"death\" of an avatar will correspond to the color of the avatar itself, and are both brighter and bigger than \"normal\" pellets, which spawn naturally throughout the world. Normal pellets do not give as much mass as pellets dropped from other worms. \"Chase\" pellets will appear individually in various places of the world, and when eaten, give a greater amount of mass than pellets dropped by other worms. Chase pellets avoid worms and flee when they draw near. Chase pellets can be obtained by boosting.\r\n\r\nBy pressing and holding the space bar or left/right mouse button (on mobile, double-tapping the touchscreen), the player can use their boost, which causes the avatar to speed up. When the button (or, on mobile, the finger on the touchscreen) is released, the worm will stop using its boost. When a player uses their boost, the worm loses some mass, causing the worm's size to shrink slightly, with the mass that is lost from the boost appearing as a line of small pellets where the boost was used. The mass lost can be regained by consuming the pellets. Similar to pellets dropped from defeated avatars, the boost pellets correspond to the color of the avatar. The boost feature is useful to outmaneuver and defeat opponents.[4] A common strategy that is used by players to defeat opponents is of the player's avatar coiling around the opponent's in a loop, until the opponent, trapped in the loop, crashes into the player.\r\n\r\nThere is a border that confines avatars within the circular game board. If a worm hits the border, the player automatically dies without turning into the aforementioned pellets. As of now it is removed, in 2016, the player with the biggest worm at the end of the day was able to share a \"victory message\" with the world. On each server, leaderboards are displayed at the top right, showing the top ten players with worms that have the most mass out of all the other worms in the entire server.\r\n\r\nDownload all your favorites: diep io (diep.io), Zombs Royale (zombsroyale.io), Agario (agar.io), Slitherio (slither.io), Paper.io (paper.io) and tons more directly our Windows Store!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NJXCDL6Z7B5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fancy Fashion Salon","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21027.13672390224487778.108bd76f-9525-4636-9721-1d9358fb7e79.ebd9a45c-a8d7-4418-bd0d-b9c2ae513189","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36386.13672390224487778.f15966d4-c288-4dd0-a6d7-2dd430e86523.f7301b88-5de7-42fb-991b-0a0ba3f0c2a5","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["53001.FancyFashionSalon_zca8h67ayrj6t"],"ContentIds":["e5991dbb-056f-1eba-bb04-9637f5d3ddba"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This fashion doll is getting ready to go to the mall.

Kingdoms is about forging alliances, political mind games, city-building and castle sieges with thousands of other players.

Whatever path they choose players will find strength in numbers as they band together, uniting with local Factions and player-led Houses.\r\n\r\nBesiege the castle that’s never been taken, overthrow ruthless tyrants, bankroll your faction’s war efforts, pillage your neighbor’s resources, peacefully raise cattle or do it all! Factions, elections, liege lords and their vassals come together to form a feudal community of real players with whom to discuss strategies and build allegiances.\r\n \r\nWhile an impregnable castle should be at the heart of any kingdom, you can also specialize with a vast research tree.

But it this was war, and the law of a good soldier was a lack of feeling. Numbing my emotions and attachments to the people and places I visited was a challenge, but I soon realized the benefit... because now I was unstoppable.\r\n\r\n**** INTENSE GAME PLAY **** \r\nLaunch a fun, fast-paced 3D mobile gaming experience upon downloading this addictive FPS game.

Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day.
