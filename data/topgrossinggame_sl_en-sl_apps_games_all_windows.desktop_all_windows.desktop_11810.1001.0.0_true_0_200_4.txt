An assisted driving system allows everyone to learn even the most extreme stunts and thanks to the three play modes, anyone can experience the thrill of a real aerobatic pilot according to their abilities. Do you think you are really an expert? Compete with the simulation mode and push your reflexes to the maximum!\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL and SPECIAL MANEUVERS\r\nDiscover all the secrets of aerobatics with 3D briefing, take complete control and activate the aircraft with the right timing on the rudder, landing gear and smoke deployment! Take off, fly and run all opening maneuvers with the C-130 “Fat Albert”, either \"PARADE PASS\" or \"ASSAULT LANDING,\" with no limits, and you just have to give it your best. Now you can sit in the cockpit as a soloist and perform an \"AILERON ROLL\" to familiarize yourself with your own F/A-18 to then use all your adrenaline in increasingly challenging and complex maneuvers up to formation flying: the \"DIAMOND ROLL,\" \"DELTA BREAK-OUT,\" and \"FLEUR DE LIS\" are just a few examples of all the possible shapes that you will be called upon to perform by covering all roles of the true Blue Angels pilots.\r\n\r\nAIRSHOW\r\nPlan your exhibition by composing real aerobatics with faithfully reproduced official scenarios: NAF El Centro, NAS Key West, Reno, Elmendorf AFB and Baltimore. Your ultimate goal is to complete all airshows! You can do this by executing the real maneuvers in sequence or randomly. You have the freedom of choice. For every maneuver, you decide what role to play: the #1 FLIGHT LEADER, one of the wings, the #2 RIGHT WING and #3 LEFT WING, the #4 SLOT or one of the soloists, the #5 LEAD and #6 OPPOSING SOLO. \r\n\r\nADDITIVE MODE\r\nCreate aerobatic figures with additive mode! Freely position the planes in the scenario you've chosen and decide whether to make them take off. You can start with a standard flight or  high altitude and then take control of each aircraft in sequence. Aim nose up, make a loop, light the smoke, fly as you like, and when you're satisfied, the session for the first plane ends and the second aircraft takes off. Choose to fly in free formation or DIAMOND, DELTA, ECHELON, and LINE ABREAST and make spectacular combinations that you can relive with the use of multi-camera replays.\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE AND SCORES\r\nOur trajectory detection system will tell you how accurate you are and the more precise you will be at all stages of the maneuver, the higher your score. Complete the figures to your best ability, exercise, win all medals and gain experience to rise to this level. This will give the you best scores and you will reach the top of the leaderboard!\r\n\r\nMAIN FEATURES:\r\n- F/A-18 fighter jets and C-130 “Fat Albert” transport aircraft\r\n- Innovative formation flying and assisted guidance system \r\n- All official Blue Angels maneuvers, playable in all roles\r\n- All configurations: takeoff, diamond, delta, echelon, line abreast and soloist\r\n\r\n- Use Airshow Mode to complete a real exhibition with a custom sequence of maneuvers\r\n- Additive Mode to create your aerobatic figure\r\n- Special missions: free flight, exploratory, pursuit and C-130 JATO\r\n\r\n- 3D Briefing display for easy understanding of the maneuver\r\n- Innovative help system with three difficulty levels to suit both beginners and more experienced pilots\r\n- Accurate trajectory measurement system for evaluation of the score\r\n\r\n- 3D virtual cockpit\r\n- Multi-camera replay system with dynamic views\r\n- 3D exploratory area to deepen knowledge of the aircraft","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PF7Z8Q1DPG1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Beholder","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59428.14209661524968334.15cd2223-5820-4ef4-b817-e30cee268bd0.0a42d910-8b4b-457d-a067-9e88225d7a38","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6120.14209661524968334.e15059e5-2e8d-466c-adca-567dc85b5c3b.18b8cb12-5178-4b9c-9709-f9803d758343","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63297.14209661524968334.71e9251b-170a-4c8e-bfd0-c2a185fba38b.dcea1d68-54cc-40f4-be2e-feb22b07ce54","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$9.99","Price":9.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["09B6C2D8.Beholder_hbbh9szp6erha"],"ContentIds":["0abc3751-eb97-a008-447f-3ea6dcce435c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Seize control of your destiny in a grim dystopian world over which the State has absolute authority. Privacy is dead in this forbidding new age but you still have to make a living. As the manager of a government-run apartment building, you must keep your residents comfortable and well-fed while fulfilling the directives of your superiors, who insist on knowing everything that's going on between your dilapidated walls.\r\n\r\nSet up surveillance equipment, spy on your tenants, and conduct clandestine searches that reveal who your neighbors are and what they're doing. With branching quests that bend to your choices, every decision you make will affect the outcome of the game. Will you secretly help a troubled tenant, or blackmail them for your person gain?

Tease your mind! •\r\n\r\nKakuro is a challenging logic puzzle game combining crosswords with numbers. If you like a challenge you will love this game! The Cross Sums game is related to other Japanese logic puzzles such as Sudoku, Nonogram, Picross and Hitori.\r\n \r\nIf you never played Kakuro, don't worry. It includes an animated tutorial to teach the basics to new players.\r\n\r\nWith highly polished graphics and smooth gameplay, Real Kakuro is a truly unique and pleasant logic puzzle experience. And best of all for Real Kakuro puzzle fans, no automatic generators with multiple solutions - all boards are included for free here! No need to pay to unlock anything.\r\n\r\nKakuro, also known as cross sums and sum totals, is like a crossword puzzle with numbers. Each \"word\" must add up to the number provided at the top of the column or to the left of the row. Words can only use the numbers 1 through 9, and a given number can only be used once in a word. Every Kakuro game can be solved through logic alone. \r\n\r\nAll puzzles have been tested and have a solution - if you get stuck in any particular board and think there is no solution, reset the board and start over. You will manage to find the correct solution if you open your mind and explore different paths.\r\n\r\nReal Kakuro puzzle is a very elegant game, providing fabulous gameplay experience with 2000 unique games in 5 different difficulty levels. Can you solve them all?\r\n\r\n• Clean board, providing hours of pleasure gameplay.\r\n• Handmade unique challenging games. All games and categories were designed to fit a 10x10 board without compromising quality and the need of zooming.\r\n• No locked levels. Play whatever you want whenever you want.\r\n• Autosave game. You don't need to worry if you don't have much time to play. It will automatically save all unfinished games.\r\n• Simple menu context. Your game is just a few clicks away.\r\n• No in-app music. You can play while listening your own music library.\r\n• High definition graphics.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PCFMHRRMP6L","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Play Real Drums - Simulator","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25865.14170743860097333.42262456-3298-4f5e-a35d-7a7baecbc2b4.30376472-37ca-4f98-b2ea-719aa13d6b1f","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31478.14170743860097333.42262456-3298-4f5e-a35d-7a7baecbc2b4.cdd109d1-cfb5-46bd-9af5-c13be1c45295","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13196.14170743860097333.42262456-3298-4f5e-a35d-7a7baecbc2b4.cc3573b8-1fcf-4e64-9ecb-8f02377b151b","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$6.99","Price":6.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["MusicBreathLLC.PlayRealDrums-Simulator_4vh60h79arzn6"],"ContentIds":["54ef178c-ca93-57c5-2fa1-923c74ef0358","e50e6b6d-7ec5-e80a-d6dc-679a0ed63a21"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Get the hottest drum kits with Play Real Drums - Simulator!

You quickly realize that the villain is entangled in a tragic, centuries-old love story, and wants to resurrect his mistress with the girl’s life force. You feel sorry for the pirate, but you have to stop him before it is too late for your daughter…\r\n  \r\nYou will leave the modern museum quickly, and find your way to rundown pirate settings, all of them three centuries old. Since the time of the golden age of piracy, the locations have become neglected, deserted and overgrown with plants. Full moon, bones laying on the ground, and a skull-shaped rock add to the dark atmosphere of the mysterious island.\r\nWhat tragic events took place on the island before your arrival? What evil powers can make an old, rotting ship sail? Is the horrifying, undead pirate really as evil as he seems? \r\n\r\nYou will find answers to these questions during your trip through the ghost ship haunting the seas of the Caribbean, the grim Skull Island where pirates’ bones cover the ground, a ruined fortress ridden by cannonballs and catacombs stretching below the island’s surface. Are you strong enough to save your daughter? Will you dare to lift the curse?\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N67QM904K8K","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"King Of Video Poker Multi Hand","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52811.14023180081698082.0ab4a539-534f-4a60-8ad5-b5d8b9094220.61407212-77f2-4f0a-9882-73f47b9d4fb5","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2933.14023180081698082.f494a25d-01f3-440c-ba00-024a02a6c831.0b2eb0d7-a624-437b-b7ae-4240b14111fb","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65015.14023180081698082.4d9b38d0-b41e-4830-9fa8-aadba0bd4856.193f3766-4441-4e06-b814-d542f8b03ec4","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52811.14023180081698082.0ab4a539-534f-4a60-8ad5-b5d8b9094220.61407212-77f2-4f0a-9882-73f47b9d4fb5","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["18010mrGambles.KingOfVideoPokerMultiHand_epmxbphxvxwe8"],"ContentIds":["b2acc90e-38fb-9ac9-3a43-b994bceed020","4d950e84-0f45-ceab-d8c7-3d2de98708b7"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"mr.

New story filled with magic, treachery and brave feats. Are you ready? \r\nThe story of the game starts in the kingdom of old Viking king Arnar. Turns out, he was cursed by a vicious dwarf. Not just a dwarf, but Loki (the Scandinavian god of mischief) himself. The reason was simple – a precious ring. Arnar found it and refused to sell it. Many years later, the curse got through to him. This is where the action begins. Arnar gives his younger son a mission to find a dwarf and return the ring. \r\nThe Vikings sailed to the setting sun for many days, until the storm scattered their drakkar on the shores of some island. They were lucky, it was the island they were looking for. Travel with Ingolf along the picturesque lands, help the locals solve their problems, make friends with a wise Druid and, most importantly, find Loki to deliver the Viking king from the curse of the ring! \r\n\r\nJOIN US! \r\n\r\nEnjoy Realore Games at: http://www.realore.com \r\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RealoreGame \r\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RealoreGames \r\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.realore.com/appprivacypolicy.php","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ31N","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Backgammon Pro","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.57265.9007199266246025.5ad63fcf-8d02-4566-81d3-397e78178cd1.cb8fdf32-a0b7-4c60-9b49-32b1aa5b4d81","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#D19048","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.41606.9007199266246025.44ca9a04-8539-4c1e-a54c-de230319be70.458e4118-0473-4ae9-9f4b-d94a506b34b6","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#D19048","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.33872.9007199266246025.11fa2e10-ab50-4655-a5ec-4aa7d8a7115c.1c1c15f0-9855-4a14-89bd-a4a4764f8f8e","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#D19048","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.42630.9007199266246025.baf06a62-a5ad-47ce-8737-737bd4c5e268.a70dd46c-bc22-4284-952d-14344e98bff3","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#D19048","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2874.9007199266246025.fa8c6e22-bccc-413a-b606-b73cbde5bcd5.846416c5-74e7-4ce9-96bb-24cf01bccfea","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#D19048","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["32988BernardoZamora.BackgammonPro_1fgex2kbsn6g8"],"ContentIds":["815ec9ff-a10d-5311-302b-07c76638f763","827ea93b-ea4c-b309-419e-0885b76c550f","12d5e003-452e-e458-57d1-90ed1c5de349"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The #1 most downloaded Backgammon app, THANK YOU!\r\n\r\nBackgammon is a board game where two players compete to get all their 15 pieces off the board before the opponent.

After ~30 games the true skill emerges.

It also offers a fun experience for beginners, with lower difficulty levels and showing possible moves.\r\n\r\nThe scoring is based on the official Backgammon ELO system, with each game increasing or

Score strikes, spares, and turkeys.\r\n\r\nPICK UP SPARES\r\n\r\nPractice challenging spares. Clear stages to unlock new balls.\r\n\r\nONE HUNDRED PINS\r\n\r\nKnock down as many pins as you can in 5 throws at a rack of 100 pins!\r\n\r\nCANDLEPIN BOWLING\r\n\r\nInvented in 1880. Candlepin bowling offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.\r\n\r\nSHUFFLE BOWLING\r\n\r\nBowling on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.\r\n\r\nWEST COUNTY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nTraditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowling has an option to purchase Candlepin, Duck Pin, Five Pin, Nine Pin, 100 pin, and Iron Pin variants. Ten pin, and spares mode are included free.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NXX7DQFDWZJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dead Reckoning: Brassfield Manor","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1663.14487379304855797.22a9620d-205b-4bc6-8034-c4f60c3e04f7.c85074fd-39c8-469a-85dc-d6e6444e7660","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23826.14487379304855797.22a9620d-205b-4bc6-8034-c4f60c3e04f7.8439182b-214f-445f-9b17-d7edadda0d8d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18079.14487379304855797.22a9620d-205b-4bc6-8034-c4f60c3e04f7.d0996b11-b4f3-4045-8297-12821d9dd38b","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34444.14487379304855797.22a9620d-205b-4bc6-8034-c4f60c3e04f7.a4315c71-1e16-4fa1-a8f8-c5b91f80e581","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$9.99","Price":9.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BigFishGames.DeadReckoningBrassfieldManor_bsrvrvej7yy2w"],"ContentIds":["651e8ef6-fbb6-d17d-161f-f1db261e04f8"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"From Eipix Entertainment, makers of Dead Reckoning: Silvermoon Isle and the Final Cut series!\r\n\r\nOn the eve of his annual murder mystery party, wealthy businessman Reginald Greer is found dead at his home.

One, two, or three games can be played at the same time in Yatzy Multi-Game Edition. First, decide how many simultaneous games to play. Then, if there is more than one player, decide who is going first.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is simply to get the highest score you can from rolling five dice.\r\n\r\nThe game lasts for 13 rounds per game. You can play up to three simultaneous games in Yatzy Multi-Game Edition.\r\n\r\nEach round, you roll the dice up to three times. In any roll, you can choose to keep some dice and re-roll others.\r\n\r\nWhen you are out of rolls or if you are satisfied with your roll before rolling three times, score the roll in one of the thirteen categories.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the game, you must fill each category with either the score you obtain or a zero.\r\n\r\nFor three of a kind, you must have at least three of the same numbers on the dice. Four of a kind requires four of the same numbers. The total of all dice are counted.\r\n\r\nA straight is a sequence of consecutive numbers. A small straight requires 4 dice and gives you thirty points while a large straight requires all five and gives you forty.\r\n\r\nA full house is accomplished by getting two of one number and three of a different number. A full house gives you twenty-five points.\r\n\r\nA Yatzy is five of a kind and gives you fifty points for the first Yatzy and one hundred points for each additional Yatzy in the same game column.\r\n\r\nThe second Yatzy must be put in the upper score box for the number you rolled if available (i.e. five 5’s would score twenty-five in the fives box and an additional one hundred points in the Yatzy bonus).\r\n\r\nIf the upper score box for the number you rolled is filled, you may place the score in any available box in the bottom section or place a zero in one of the boxes in the upper section.\r\n\r\nMost players choose to put all Yatzys in the same game column and zero out the others. This will give you the highest maximum Yatzy bonuses.\r\n\r\nChance is a catch-all and you may use it to place any score that you don’t want to place anywhere else. Use your chance box wisely.\r\n\r\nAbove all, have fun as you play Yatzy Multi-Game Edition!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Now she needs to find a way back home - and also save her planet.\r\n \r\nIt was late evening and the museum was almost empty. At the Maya artifact exhibition, one of the exhibits suddenly started to move. The sound drew the attention of a young woman named Diana, a museum employee and an expert in Mayan culture. When she came closer to the artifact she realized it looked like a portal... and suddenly some unknown power lifted her up and teleported her to an ancient temple! Now Diana has to figure out where she is, how she got there and how she's going to return home. The young woman encounters a civilization similar to the Mayan culture, but this is neither the past nor a parallel reality.

The memories still burn deeply, like spicy chicken wings.\r\n\r\n\"They came without warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled feathers darkening the sun. Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity for our oppression of their earthly brethren.\r\n\r\n\"I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger I set my lasers to \"extra crispy\" and blasted off to intercept the fowl invaders.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying, the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this planet.\r\n\r\n\"After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.\r\n\r\n\"Little did I know that my greatest adventure was yet to come...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ultimate Omelette\" is the title of the fourth episode in the Chicken Invaders series of casual space shooter games. The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.\r\n\r\nThe enemy repertoire has been significantly broadened, introducing several different kinds of chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated by fights against boss enemies spanning up to three times the size of the screen. The arsenal at the player's disposal has also been correspondingly extended, with three new weapons and four kinds of supporting satellites providing additional firepower.

The gameplay in 'Rescue Team' is intuitive. In each of the game's 60 levels, simply tap the screen to free workers trapped by debris, then repair damaged restaurants and sawmills to produce resources, and then patch up bridges, helicopter pads and boat docks to restore the infrastructure.

For those that want a puzzle that lasts more than a few minutes. And now an unlimited supply of automatically generated 9 x 9 Sudokus for when you want a quick puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe Samurai and Super Sudokus come in three levels of difficulty, none of them are trivial or easy.  These are Sudoku that will take a bit of time to solve.  And if you complete one you will have solved it.  There are no cheats or hints to allow you to carry on if you get stuck. The 9x9 Sudoku come in four levels of difficulty with the most difficult requiring slightly harder solving techniques than the larger puzzles.\r\n\r\nThere are aids to help with some of the legwork though, the Sudoku will auto fill and update pencil marks showing all of the possible numbers available in each square and you can highlight all squares that can hold a possible number allowing patterns to be seen.  But, there is nothing in the Sudoku to shortcut the mental process required to complete it.\r\n\r\nThe list of Sudoku now shows whether automatic pencil marks or number highlighting have been used and the best time for each Sudoku will reflect this, if you complete a Sudoku without using assistance this will be recorded as your best even if it was slower than a previous attempt where assistance was used.\r\n\r\nThe Sudoku auto save so you can have several on the go at any time.\r\n\r\nAlso for traditionalists or the masochistic you can email a Sudoku to your computer to be printed out and solved the hard way with no highlighting assistance using a pen and paper.\r\n\r\nBecause of the size of the Sudoku this app will work best on a PC, tablet  or large screen phone.  However, the grid can be zoomed so play on almost any device should be possible with a pit of patience.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1JSPC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Game Studio Tycoon 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.526.13510798885991542.5d0ad3e2-ee92-46b4-835e-d9c2230efa96.92a2ba77-e250-4bd5-95a3-dc290bf8c1b4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.11525.13510798885991542.4c8452bd-937d-438c-980e-86def213c9cc.65b79eb6-62df-4cd8-b94f-2b975a90dace","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.10700.13510798885991542.05038831-f8e9-45cd-9db3-d55988fd9779.45d94a14-1948-4baa-89ac-333b3fd84d2b","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29393.13510798885991542.cc4c1900-f264-48f5-953b-a7ec39add34d.73c5e40d-b286-492b-9f46-cd4e5a2f1901","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53773.13510798885991542.9fcc2f7f-4bee-4bff-b85b-8e061ba7270c.8561047b-433b-48eb-bb57-398d2d77d1c8","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63122.13510798885991542.4146c49a-9cd0-4dce-b6cc-bccf982bc634.5ee2f747-764a-4c32-b26d-ee9a287b3b7d","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.62675.13510798885991542.ad9ae20a-8e3b-4f28-b0a8-8428e188fe35.362b7d9f-0289-494d-93f7-29e098ca2bd1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$2.99","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["12401MichaelSherwin.GameStudioTycoon2_jfyqapq4zvm82"],"ContentIds":["04e342f7-e274-3e1f-2f6a-570999fd151a","79dd4223-9049-07c6-3460-0c2a57280b79"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"NOTE: This app requires devices to have at least 1 GB of RAM!\r\n\r\nStart as an independent game dev; become the world’s greatest game studio!\r\n\r\nWelcome to the next generation of game development!
