mindblowing bike racing action set in a huge urban sprawl called The City. Separated into a set of districts, each with its own look and real feel. Prepare for heart-stopping and breathtaking thrills you have never seen in mobile games before.\r\n\r\nRIDE EPIC BIKES\r\nRace on a huge selection of easily customizable motorcycles ranging from badass choppers to fast motocross bikes. All prepped up, loaded with nitro and ready to unleash their full fury on the asphalt below.\r\nThere’s also a treat for all of the dirt fanatics out there - you can drive real quads. Experience speed that cannot be stopped by anything less than a brick wall!\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE THE BIGGEST AND THE BADDEST\r\nFeel the adrenaline overload as you start racing against the biker gangs that rule The City. They are the famous 1%, the outlaw bike racers who thrive on crime and their need for the rush of speed. They believe that all of the best things in the world are for free (when you take them forcibly) and that having fun in life is the only thing that matters. Except for power and money, of course.\r\n\r\nEXPRESS YOURSELF\r\nCustomize your bike with unique tuning - slap some decals and paint it with your favourite color. Go crazy with the combinations, it’s your ride - your rules. In illegal drag racing competitions being creative about your bike is the only way to become known and respected.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE THE URBAN SPRAWL\r\nThe City is split into districts, each run by a different bike gang. You’ll have to beat all of the renegade bikers if you hope to assume direct control over The City. Race in a deep selection of realistic game modes and challenges.\r\n\r\nBECOME A LEGEND OF THE ROAD\r\nThe great highway awaits for those brave enough to compete with the best racing competitors in the world of underground bike community. You have to be hardcore to keep up with the criminal kings of the road - but the prize for the best moto racer is really big. Do you think you can become the new bike gang leader of The City?\r\n\r\nEASY RIDER\r\nThis bike racing game is optimized to work smooth on most devices. Additionally it was translated into 17 languages from all over the world. Nothing can stop you from owning the streets now!\r\nSee you on the road, player!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5NWZ4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Paper Toss Mania","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62869.13510798887114689.de5a1996-7e16-4e13-afd4-2d99063674e3.6de6a127-b761-4460-b768-0f963a1acdc5","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63840.13510798887114689.7805e77c-6ce8-4429-8962-15abb7fea1a8.0303495b-082f-4b14-921d-a9f6cc1a9298","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47678.13510798887114689.4140c365-8d67-4af0-a9bc-48485ca7d7ad.1b44f729-58e1-46fa-bed8-847b74562186","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41876.13510798887114689.b0be28cb-ce6f-40fc-87bb-11c4ad9bd820.56e8d705-ec0b-4970-8ed6-660713b4d37b","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5123.13510798887114689.153ccb20-faf9-43c4-8771-d487d2d2815e.06888597-1d2a-44a9-911c-7214a610db79","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9867.13510798887114689.d0019864-b117-4cdb-b46d-305822791348.adb7067e-e337-4dab-b603-47aacf00ffa9","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23299.13510798887114689.56be240d-260e-46bd-ae52-c60b151dad8a.cc824c8a-8fb6-438f-a33f-7a5215598870","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41591.13510798887114689.b1696a70-9901-477b-8b6c-dddf467fcb09.3033eba1-abd1-4a79-8cf6-772bf7b1c696","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51969.13510798887114689.cc9f7bcf-f683-4546-9717-ac3a64e99f67.d5b6c423-5861-4910-b0d9-71acb39a5e95","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6113.13510798887114689.ed0fecb2-4b62-4b49-9b39-7764f842695c.301716d3-6f26-4f80-bc16-2cc08910341c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["11626BreakGame.PaperTossMania_y00h131bzaq9c"],"ContentIds":["e7b1a77d-01eb-957e-fbb4-367ed1559682"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Download the amazing and hilarious game for office killing time.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the free game targeting the bin with different and unique objects to throw.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color.

As in a puzzle, you have a board and you must find out which symbol – or piece - goes in each box  \r\n\r\n👽 and where is the logic?\r\n🙂 the game gives you logical clues, so you can deduce what symbol goes in what box  \r\n\r\n👽 What do you mean by logical clues?\r\n🙂 the logical clues are of the style of:  these pieces are on the board and these others are not, or only one of these two is correct, or at least one of these two pieces is not correct. or ...  \r\n\r\n👽 and that is logic?\r\n🙂 Absolutely. It’s based on the propositional logic. Propositional logic is universal, and all of us use it even without noticing it.\r\n\r\nIt means that everyone can to follow this logic. Apparently, the clues hide the response of the game, but from the clues you can deduce the correct answers  \r\n\r\n👽 Is it like in an intriguing or detective novel?\r\n🙂 You can also see it that way. The reasoning can be similar, you must find a clue to start, chain clues, follow false leads and discard them, realize that if something is false, it can mean that something else is true. \r\n\r\nYes, in fact, every time we reason in a logical way, we do it in the same way: in a logical way  \r\n\r\n👽 Ok, start to like me. Tell me more\r\n🙂I assure you that when you deduct the clues and arrive at the solution you take a joy. \r\n\r\nThe challenge is fun. \r\n\r\nIt's not exactly liked a novel or a detective movie because the game is totally symbolic. It is a board game and you can play again and again, and each game is different  \r\n\r\n👽 but it seems that you should use the same skill, right? \r\n🙂 Certainly, as we have said before, the logic used in ItsLogic is universal. You can even see it as a logic gym. \r\n\r\nIn that sense, you can be sure that it will help you develop your logical thinking while you are enjoying yourself  \r\n\r\n👽 Is it easy?\r\n🙂 You can imagine that you start easy and it gets complicated, but with ItsLogic  you can always decide the level of complexity in which you want to play in each moment. \r\n\r\nIn addition, sometimes you want to play a series of simple and fast games, while other times you want the challenge of a complex game    \r\n\r\n👽 What if you get stuck?\r\n🙂 Practically all of us will find levels of the game that are easy for us, other levels that will be a challenge and other levels that seem impossible.\r\n\r\nAs we continue to dominate the game the bar will go up and more and more games will be affordable.\r\n\r\nBut sooner or later, as normal, we can find games that we do not know how to deal with:  You get stuck, and that is annoying.\r\n\r\nMany times, we would just need an idea, or an example, other times we would just have to have some tool, such as being able to point out what we are deducting, or that something or someone tells you what the next step is. ItsLogic knows that\r\n\r\nItsLogic has a lot of help tools so you never get stuck. You can use the tools to learn, to get a push or just to adapt the game to the level of complexity you want. \r\n\r\nStaying stuck is not fun and solving games is fun. \r\n\r\nWith ItsLogic you can solve from the simplest game to the most complex. It's part of the game.\r\n\r\n👽 It's logical, I'm going to develop my logical thinking while I'm having fun, I'm not going to be alone if I get stuck ... I'm going to try it\r\n\r\n🙂 Well, sounds logical\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MW25ZMHPJW5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Chess html5","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5024.13852404203127536.a5c49519-9466-4f8f-8b40-7f59b987e8f5.7f2e57a1-b4cc-4a5e-a74d-593ffbb30f98","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34591.13852404203127536.a5c49519-9466-4f8f-8b40-7f59b987e8f5.9b686524-8d1f-4fc4-af3d-e6f38f45834c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18505.13852404203127536.a5c49519-9466-4f8f-8b40-7f59b987e8f5.d15714ad-08ae-4660-89e3-a7456616cbd2","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26346.13852404203127536.a5c49519-9466-4f8f-8b40-7f59b987e8f5.f37a994e-651a-4f25-94a5-19d87da7def6","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["5514tejasbst.Chesshtml5_b3qv8x3a3yara"],"ContentIds":["7f1c6537-6e72-5799-76a3-861cef7468ff","48f914a7-236a-88ca-dfab-a228592334a4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play Chess online with your friend or alone.

You can match any uncovered card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload and play now!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Unlimited Undo\r\n\r\n✓ Advanced Hint Option\r\n\r\n✓ Intuitive Interface\r\n\r\n✓ daily/monthly/all time highscores\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Clear as many boards as you can by matching pairs of cards to get the value 13. Aces count as 1, Jacks count as 11, Queens count as 12 and Kings count as 13.\r\n\r\n✓ You can tap away the king with just one move. To eliminate a queen, you need to match it with an ace. \r\n\r\n✓ On the board you will find a pyramid of cards and a stack from which you draw cards. If there are no available matches you can continue to draw from the stack.\r\n\r\n✓ You can draw the entire stack three times over. Once there are no more turns to draw you can deal a new deck of cards.\r\n\r\n✓ You can only deal two times. If you eliminate a pyramid of cards, you complete one board and you receive an extra deal.\r\n\r\n✓ For each pair you receive 10 points. You receive bonus points when you continue to match pairs without drawing new cards. \r\n\r\n✓ You receive 2000 points for completing one board.\r\n\r\n✓ When you run out of options, you can tap Hint for a suggestion.\r\n\r\n✓ You can also undo a move by pressing Undo.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

(Free users can view the top 100, but not save.)  Customize your experience by storing a name for high scores, changing the font, button images and sounds!  \r\n\r\nThere are 3 different textures for the buttons, and 3 different sound settings. Changing themes doesn't affect game play, but you can only change these on your turn. Currently supported are plain flat buttons, raised, plastic looking buttons, and metallic buttons.

Play from anywhere no matter where you are - including during your office meetings that you love so much. Just don’t let your boss catch you with your phone out! Your co-workers are probably playing the same game with their own smartphones! This is the same old Blackjack you know the game, right? The idea is to beat the house by netting as close to twenty-one as possible. If you’ve never played before it seems a lot easier  than it actually is, so don’t get too cocky. The dealer will continue to hand out cards until you bust by getting a total well over twenty-one, or until you tell them to stop. To win, you must be closer to twenty-one than the house, otherwise known as the dealer. Place a bet before every hand, and if you win you’ll increase your earnings. Don’t raise your bet too high though or you will lose all of your cash if the house beats you! The beauty of this online card game is that......you don’t have to visit a casino to play, and you don’t have to lose real money. Heck, you don’t even have to leave your house to get in on the action! Just pull up a chair, plop yourself down and start tossing money onto the table. Keep a close eye on your cards though, you don’t want to bust and lose what you’ve put down. Well, what are you waiting for? Get in there and place some bets! Challenge your friends and family and compete to see who can make the most money in Blackjack. How much will you make? Will you become a Blackjack millionaire? There’s only one way to find out.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZTQBK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Racing Car Drift","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52656.13510798883422394.a28bdccd-8df0-4cb2-9b4d-f9ae4555e0d7.5dcb4884-e2f0-4791-81a9-3922ff295caf","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40281.13510798883422394.abe72ece-05c4-4e2c-b710-f918f0f08700.d2fb5b8a-b4a1-4626-bd12-3ab938da7b1e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40544.13510798883422394.e64e7c60-e807-4f7d-a268-8cd36e5cd249.8bfa2a9a-6ce5-4f86-9126-921f7e6e555d","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57232.13510798883422394.c924db6c-c2d0-4eb4-ba00-cd9ed860c039.7a33d917-1009-48f1-b3a6-b3748de69c95","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15648.13510798883422394.fb6a410c-6adc-4892-a040-a4c609e765c9.7b6746fe-0877-4543-8681-b5c7213b268d","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65001.13510798883422394.85a11cba-0cdd-4ff2-930f-0e19487905ea.0cbda0d0-b821-43f9-811b-47a71436a779","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["41106virtualinfocom.RacingCarDrift_s1jpvp2zdr2hj"],"ContentIds":["a20cd828-6e74-68ae-3e47-58db9dbe6c90","7e284017-20dc-0807-1a32-58148faee2c4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play hard, drift your car on the Hills and run through the 3D Environment. \r\nDrift car through the hills.

For those that want a puzzle that lasts more than a few minutes. And now an unlimited supply of automatically generated 9 x 9 Sudokus for when you want a quick puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe Samurai and Super Sudokus come in three levels of difficulty, none of them are trivial or easy.  These are Sudoku that will take a bit of time to solve.  And if you complete one you will have solved it.  There are no cheats or hints to allow you to carry on if you get stuck. The 9x9 Sudoku come in four levels of difficulty with the most difficult requiring slightly harder solving techniques than the larger puzzles.\r\n\r\nThere are aids to help with some of the legwork though, the Sudoku will auto fill and update pencil marks showing all of the possible numbers available in each square and you can highlight all squares that can hold a possible number allowing patterns to be seen.  But, there is nothing in the Sudoku to shortcut the mental process required to complete it.\r\n\r\nThe list of Sudoku now shows whether automatic pencil marks or number highlighting have been used and the best time for each Sudoku will reflect this, if you complete a Sudoku without using assistance this will be recorded as your best even if it was slower than a previous attempt where assistance was used.\r\n\r\nThe Sudoku auto save so you can have several on the go at any time.\r\n\r\nAlso for traditionalists or the masochistic you can email a Sudoku to your computer to be printed out and solved the hard way with no highlighting assistance using a pen and paper.\r\n\r\nBecause of the size of the Sudoku this app will work best on a PC, tablet  or large screen phone.  However, the grid can be zoomed so play on almost any device should be possible with a pit of patience.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1R62S","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Real Roller Coaster Simulator","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6870.13510798886163587.090e4879-1a70-4eaa-89bc-50df78302c8b.aad92981-639a-4254-87e5-c39c6da355c7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41863.13510798886163587.ba503e86-20bb-4a39-81c0-1aade5a5abe5.191fc44a-61dd-4e82-8899-3cc5acbbd615","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.3,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["50154AVLogix.RealRollerCoasterSimulator_q7ke2emr2nmbw"],"ContentIds":["adc393f2-4b9c-10a3-70a3-46ddd1981c58","50a701dc-f1d5-6f3a-f46c-9a95a252c9ee"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you are looking for Roller Coaster Games that has huge enthusiastic moments and collections of stunning wonderful HD display and graphics, the search is over!!

looking for a fun yet comprehensive Rubber and Chicago Bridge game then look no further.  The 2019 edition of Bridge features faster and stronger game play with smoother user interface.\r\n\r\nBridge is a card game played by four players who form two partnerships. Players within a partnership face each other across the bridge table. Traditionally, the players are referred to by the points of the compass - North, East, South and West. The two partnerships are North/South and East/West. Games are played to the best of three.  During bidding, each partnership exchanges information to decide a contract. Once established the cards are played with the declarer attempting to fulfill the contract + the opponents attempting to defeat it.\r\n\r\nBridge includes the all new state of the art advanced Bridge card play engine playing at a significantly stronger level. By analysing the probable permutations of the remaining cards Bridge will frequently find an extra trick to make or defeat a contract. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\nThis game is ad-funded.
