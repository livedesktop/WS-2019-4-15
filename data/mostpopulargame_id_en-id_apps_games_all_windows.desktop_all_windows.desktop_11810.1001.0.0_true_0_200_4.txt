We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too.

chain of marbles is inexorably rolling towards a secret chamber and you can’t let them reach it? That’s right, you shoot those marbles with other marbles in order to remove marbles. Sounds silly, but that's how it is! Aim with your Tiki stone to shoot marbles of the same color into the chain. If you match 3 or more marbles they will disappear.\r\n\r\nBigger combos will grant bigger bonuses and even specials. And if that’s not enough for you there are power ups that will assist you greatly in your challenge to eliminate brightly colored rolling marbles.\r\n\r\nOf course there are power ups. For example there is a fire power-up that will allow you to spit awesome fire balls for a short amount of time and destroy all marbles that get in the way. No need to match 3 marbles, just shoot fireballs wherever you want.\r\n\r\nAnother fan favorite is the lightning power-up that will randomly shoot lightning beams and destroy several marbles across the screen at once. A really helpful feature is the option to swap between two marbles before every shot. If you don’t find a good spot to shoot a marble, swapping may give you a big advantage.\r\n\r\nBut either way your one and only goal is to destroy the whole chain of marbles before the first marble reaches the exit. So your main antagonist is time. And your aiming skills, of course.\r\n\r\nIf you loved Peggle Montezuma, marble woka woka Zuma Deluxe, World of Zuma or Zumas Temple Quest, you will love this game. Zuma Totemia is the perfect game for all Match 3 fans that want a little more action and excitement.

Use the dark shadows\r\nWatch your stealth visibility indicator at the bottom/right of the screen closely to see how visible you are.

Use your ammunition wisely throughout the missions as you may come cross critical situations when you will desperately need your weapons.\r\n3. Drag guards into the shadow\r\nTo avoid any later detection of knocked out guards you need to be sure to drag them out of sight into a dark corner or behind cover. Detection of a guards leads to the alarm being raised and will negatively impact your stealth % score.\r\n4. Be patient\r\nThey key to any stealth game is to be patient and observe the situation and then take measured and planning action accordingly.\r\n\r\nYour gadgets\r\nComplete missions and you will be rewarded by the syndicate with new high-tech gadgets allowing you to complete the most challenging heists against all odds.

The goal is to end the game such that you have larger number of discs on the board compared to your opponent. It is a classic game originally thought of being invented in England, and is also known as Reversi. The game is very easy to learn, but requires considerable practice to master.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4NL4S","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Helicopter Flight Simulator 3D - Checkpoints","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30093.13510798887473535.41718f61-753b-4cea-8af7-fe742cc1d12e.730fd087-6f2e-4699-8bc9-a0b809138c4b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27255.13510798887473535.41718f61-753b-4cea-8af7-fe742cc1d12e.27cf834d-8429-4fc8-b035-e6da021fe738","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14882.13510798887473535.9af3700c-9809-4d32-a1a0-0ad95fd19efb.0bb83de7-831d-4488-82ea-fac3a160e5e6","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["TeenGamesLLC.HelicopterSimulator3DFree-ContinuumRe_6vxev4a3a8z3p"],"ContentIds":["600fd445-66f3-5c2c-91f4-cefd21decdeb","84c78790-215f-70f1-a61e-9d63e1090410"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"In a huge city disasters happen almost everyday.

on the face of the planet. These amazing animals boggle our imagination by their variety and size. Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Today, archaeologists study the remains of these animals and can only assume how they looked and lived.  \r\n\r\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\r\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

Play against 1 to 3 computer opponents. Match pieces with the same number of dots.\r\n\r\nThe game begins by shuffling the dominoes and dealing a hand to each player. With two players, each one starts with 7 dominoes, with more players, each one starts with 5 dominoes. The player with the lowest double in their hand makes the first move. \r\n\r\nExcept for Block dominoes, if a player cannot make a move, they must draw dominoes from the boneyard until they get a domino that they can play. A player who cannot make a move and cannot draw because the boneyard is empty \r\nor they are playing Block dominoes, must pass their turn. \r\nIn All-Fives dominoes, If a domino is played and the sum total of all four sides is a multiple of 5, the player earns those points.\r\n\r\nThe round is complete when a player plays all of their tiles, or when a game is blocked and no more moves can be made. At the end of a round, the player with the lightest hand (least number of dots on their remaining dominoes) \r\nwins a point bonus - sum of all of their opponents dominoes minus any dominoes still left in the winner's hand.\r\n\r\nTo move tap a domino you want to place. If there is only one place it can go, game will place it automatically. Otherwise tap or drag-and-drop it to the connecting domino.\r\n\r\nThis free version is supported by 3rd party ads.

It’s the most popular ever happening games in many countries. \r\n\r\nLudo (from Latin ludo, \"I play\") is a strategy board game in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to rolls of a single die. \r\n\r\nLudo is derived from the Indian game Parchisi, but simpler. The game and its variants are popular in many countries and under various names.\r\n\r\nParchisi originated in India by the 6th century. \r\n\r\nEach player rolls the die; the highest roller begins the game. Players alternate turns in a clockwise direction.\r\n\r\nLudo can be played by two, three, or four, without partnerships. To enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a 6. If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a 6, the turn passes to the next player. Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the dice. Players must always move a token according to the die value rolled. Passes are not allowed; if no move is possible, the turn moves to the next player.\r\n\r\nPlayers may not end their move on a square they already occupy.
