Either way, the last player standing wins, earning Medallions that will unlock new monkey towers, powerful upgrades, and cool bloon decals with which you can customize your attacks. \r\n\r\nIf you are new to Bloons tower defense games, don't worry - a helpful tutorial walks you through the game, and matchmaking will help balance the opponents you face. And if you want to battle against your friends, you can easily create and join private matches with anyone on your Facebook friends list. \r\n\r\nThe choice of strategy is yours - hunker down for the long game, or go for the quick win with a rush of fast Bloons?

Play the original family board game for free wherever you may be. Find out why millions of people have played this classic board game for over 50 years!\r\n\r\nYatzy is a dice game, which was first marketed as \"Yatzie\" in the early 1940s. \r\n\r\nYatzie was included in a game set called \"LUCK - 15 Grand Dice Games\".\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. The dice can be rolled up to three times in a turn to try to make various scoring combinations. A game consists of thirteen rounds. After each round the player chooses which scoring category is to be used for that round. \r\n\r\nOnce a category has been used in the game, it cannot be used again. The scoring categories have varying point values, some of which are fixed values and others where the score depends on the value of the dice. A Yatzy is five-of-a-kind and scores 50 points; the highest of any category. The winner is the player who scores the most points.\r\n\r\nThe Yatzy scorecard contains 13 different category boxes and in each round, after the third roll, the player must choose one of these categories. The score entered in the box depends on how well the five dice match the scoring rule for the category. Details of the scoring rules for each category are given below. As an example, one of the categories is called Three of a Kind. The scoring rule for this category means that a player only scores if at least three of the five dice are the same value. The game is completed after 13 rounds by each player, with each of the 13 boxes filled. The total score is calculated by summing all thirteen boxes, together with any bonuses.\r\n\r\nThe Yatzy scorecard or score sheet contains 13 scoring boxes divided between two sections:\r\n- Upper section \r\n- Lower section\r\n\r\nA Yatzy is a 5 of a Kind (i.e. all the die faces are the same), and it scores 50 points. If you roll more than one Yatzy in a single game, you will earn a 100 point bonus for each additional Yatzy roll, provided that you have already scored a 50 in the Yatzy category. If you have not scored in the Yatzy category, you will not receive a bonus. If you have scored a zero in the Yatzy category, you cannot receive any bonuses during the current game.\r\n\r\nPlay the classic Yatzy online with buddies or against a series of increasingly challenging opponents.\r\n\r\nYatzy pro game is not only simple, but actually a lot of fun, regardless of whether you’re a child or an adult.\r\n\r\nRoll your way to fast fun with this amazing version of Yatzy HD board game that's been a family favorite.\r\n\r\nUse your math and strategy skills to achieve victory.\r\n\r\nSo what are you waiting for?

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG1V9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The Secret Society - Hidden Mystery","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30442.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.a1f68e71-0df4-44a0-b446-85e6616d5455","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7278.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.f923621d-329f-4129-92b4-cc260499bf13","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36746.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.5f80cc20-98c7-4a63-b3e0-c7f40ab4d1a0","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35023.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.a8896fd1-96af-4450-a03e-5b17751561ec","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55625.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.5d2cdc49-e3e8-4489-9ce5-6efd1aec3bff","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26051.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.c4d33e64-3093-485a-a81f-05d05bdfb719","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8829.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.7e68c6b9-324f-4358-b7b2-c64510e4d678","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32118.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.eb55292a-d6c0-4a5b-8086-0cb0935ac716","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13488.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.c7121d02-850c-4c6b-8386-42ca78d7e93d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36657.9007199266304174.0d272481-0921-4ad1-808f-aeae9e5a0039.80a6a789-3b23-4f63-8576-d77994fb19da","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.TheSecretSociety-HiddenMystery_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["076fc4eb-6fc5-e9ee-70b1-39ad10db366c","86f4f1bf-59ae-19cf-3b44-176885a43c25","0daf8426-2815-35fc-0b25-3221576f34c9"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"LIMITED TIME OFFER!

This thrilling mystery merges elements of classical horror and gritty, 50’s-style noir. \r\n\r\nA paranormal private investigator is contacted by her friend, famous reporter Helen Hunter, whose voice sounds small and terrified in the voicemail. She is in the coastal town of Serpent Creek, and needs help immediately.  \r\n\r\nBut upon arriving in Serpent Creek, the detective finds no trace of Ms. Hunter. And the manager of the nearby hotel, in which she supposedly stayed, claims to have never even seen her.\r\n\r\nWeirder still is the fact the town’s streets are crawling with snakes, and the citizens seem to be sleepwalking through life. The ground shakes with violent tremors.\r\n\r\nThis case will certainly challenge the protagonist’s skills as a detective. She must save her friend, reveal the corruption and hidden agendas of the town’s citizens, and, most importantly, stop an evil plot to bring the Snake God back to our world.\r\n\r\nWhen investigating Serpent Creek, the detective will perform true investigative work: finding clues and combining them to learn the secrets of every crime scene in the all new Detective Mode! What’s more, she will crack codes, pick locks and solve clever puzzles along the way.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDH8VM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Flats","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52337.9007199266337408.8dc9998b-ad09-41f1-a891-f10622867bfe.dc835f3e-8e14-4ba4-b7e2-31dbbcc23c6d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#ff3f9f","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37072.9007199266337408.046b5acd-05f1-41fe-8608-89aef2da925a.c97b1d00-60bf-4f32-85df-86801d041765","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#ff3f9f","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6565.9007199266337408.e8bb931c-a7d7-4232-9727-7f4d085352e6.222a9cd9-d8cc-4dfc-ab6c-760c330d9c22","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#ff3f9f","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["FoliageGamesLLC.Flats_arh4z6sc73q8a"],"ContentIds":["2f314776-e276-59d7-19c2-2c12c1b9afd9","3755f656-a192-ec9a-cb09-bb8e4c2881cf"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Flats is a Multiplayer/singleplayer cross-platform FPS. \r\nYou don't have to signup or register, just download and play.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer: Including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch,Territories, Capture the Flag, Blow up the Base(Bomb), Zombie, VIP, Co-op Survival.\r\n\r\nSingleplayer:Survival, Assortment, Headshot Challenge\r\n\r\nOn desktop, you should use mouse/keyboard or gamepad.\r\nOn mobile, you can use touch control.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- New menu: You can switch singleplayer to multiplayer or multiplayer to singleplayer easily.
