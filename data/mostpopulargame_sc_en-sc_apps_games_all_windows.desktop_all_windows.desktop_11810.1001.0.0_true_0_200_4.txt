The deep snow in the winters has made it difficult for people to move around and tourists are also planning skiing trips and you have to transport the passengers and ski gear to offroad deep snow mountain tracks. Drive the snow tourist bus and pick n drop the passengers. You also have to pick the tourists from snowy hill resorts to city. Deep snow has made it very difficult & dangerous to drive on the narrow roads of the city and off road tracks have become even more risky. Make sure you don't hit the traffic and people on the road as it is really cold due to snow blizzards and the roads have become narrower. Snowy Bus Drive is a challenging game testing driving skills in risky and dangerous conditions and difficult paths. Hill drivers are really experts in cutting those hilly corners and curves but snow adds to the risk and challenge. Tourists in the mountain top resorts are depending for their survival on you so that they can reach the city safe and sound. Be the best snow bus driver on city and off-road conditions.\r\n\r\nUse the controls to accelerate and brake according to the conditions. Drive carefully and make sure you can see your way in the snow and control the bus on the skiddy ice. It is like a thin sheet of glass on the roads. Everything is covered in snow from the hill tops & mountain to roads to houses to hotels. The met department has reported that the snow storm is likely to keep at this pace for many days to come and people cannot use their cars to travel in this weather. Since you are one of the only few bus drivers providing the transport services in these tough hilly conditions on off-road and city roads, you have to be fast and rush to your destination to pick as many passengers as possible. People are depending upon you to reach their homes for Christmas and New Year. You are an expert snow driver who can make all this happen.\r\n\r\nYou have multiple game play missions in hilly off road conditions to complete so be ready for the kicks and excitement. Just launch into the game and drive away and you have to make sure you are driving safe. You will experience both city and off-road environment and view many scenic views of mountains and hills while you are driving in the snowy conditions. Drive the extreme snow bus drive away!\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the game. Your comments & ratings are welcome and will help us in creating even better games for you.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4NLN8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fight of Death : Street Fighting Tiger","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55487.13510798887473295.20c8dc98-8244-4077-9bde-54e9ebd4d4d5.3071eeba-e3c0-48d5-80ab-4876529e63ad","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3135.13510798887473295.23f93c32-282b-4d00-abd9-56d00760089f.a22bffcf-b008-4062-8845-8c837316f7d4","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14103.13510798887473295.f6e5bc24-8cb4-4894-8fe8-8f41c5b7df3e.4a84a09c-2aa2-4cf9-a99e-6ee92ac07483","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["31252IrfanShafi.FightofDeathStreetFightingTiger_m164m09tj2s82"],"ContentIds":["982ce64f-74a6-724a-eded-12a20a179660","ab3cf13d-d4bc-7401-0d05-9ce81c9987ee"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Fight of Death Street Fighting Tiger is one of the best and advance surly magnificence fighting game of modern era, Fight to earn you respect, put your anger in your mind and smash opponent.

The rain was pouring down and lightning was striking the trees & mountains outside. Foster thought about his battalion and wondered where they are – the weather had made him loose his tracks. He tried to make plans to go out as soon as the weather gets better and regroup with his men and find his way out in this unknown valley.\r\n\r\nThe morning light brought with it calmness to the weather. It was still raining but it was possible to go out and look for his men and hunt for some food.\r\n\r\nIt is time to load up your sniper rifle and jump into the wilds. Play the role of Captain Foster and help him feed himself. You have one Elite Sniper Rifle which can be used for hunting but if you use your Elite shooting skills and successfully hunt some deer, you can buy high range sniper guns.\r\n\r\nTo kill a deer, simply find it with help of long range gun scope and follow deer’s tracks to take a clear headshot. Keep in mind though that you are among the wilds and trying to eat what would have ended up as the lion’s food. You have to hunt the deer before getting to the loins or you will lose the hunt and the lions can you.\r\n\r\nYou will see beautiful sceneries like wildlife, forest and mountains in the game and enjoy the sounds of weapons, lions, birds and family of Red & Mole dear's.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4NW06","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Desert Commando Adventure Shooting","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47658.13510798887482965.35912e6a-c484-4e94-920d-8c0e520d353d.2a531dd1-bf9e-463d-85ab-bae7687d9263","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32627.13510798887482965.af1d698c-8b5d-4817-9509-9e8d01fcc93b.d1bb6971-c5df-4e6b-a789-cfec4a20593d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2140.13510798887482965.ed174965-9cf9-46bd-bbb9-5f9d8c3b598f.2fa1def1-a77a-4774-94be-c35732e12c1d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["31252IrfanShafi.DesertCommandoAdventureShootingThe_m164m09tj2s82"],"ContentIds":["d8c88d86-cf7a-a91a-cd8c-c7f7d9d49fcb","9668c3a2-b7db-10ef-b259-513d23f2057b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Desert Commando Adventure Shooting is real war game.

Beautiful flowers make them feel the joys of spring, and the painting process turns into an enthralling game where they can bring their fantasies to life and draw a red daffodil, or a blue sunflower.\r\n\r\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\r\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste. Try the program right now!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,
