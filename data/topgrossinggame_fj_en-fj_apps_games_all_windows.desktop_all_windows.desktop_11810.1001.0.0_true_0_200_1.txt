Walk around this 3D pixel world and confront deadly enemies all while collection an assortment of sophisticated, modern day weapons, ammo and health.

Enemies are everywhere and you must defeat every last one in order to claim the title as ultimate victor. \r\n\r\n??Time is running out...??\r\n\r\nI am a prisoner on a planet in a galaxy devoid of human life. I know little about my origins, only that the planet had seen a total annihilation of human life centuries ago at the hands of the robots who dominated it and I was the last human on earth. I exist in a cell so tiny that I cannot lay flat, but rather have to sleep in the fetal position. My cell is always cold and drips waste from the city above. I have seen light very few times in my existence, but when I have, I was chained in manacles and paraded about the city to the delight of the robots and their fat, alien comrades. I harbored no hope of leaving this place. That was, until six months ago when I heard it whispered between wardens that a planet was discovered where humans not only exist, they thrive. The word war was being bandied about, but I cared naught of their tactics, for the first bloom of hope had sprung to life in my chest. For the first time since I was a wee boy and my spunk was beaten mercilessly from me, I was determined to be more than a prisoner. Despite the size of my cage, I refused to let my surroundings hinder my plans of escape. I worked out tirelessly, working my weary bones until I could start to feel the strength building in my body. I would escape, but to fully succeed and reunite with those of my own ilk, I would need to confront these foes and escape this hell hole altogether. This is my tale, the story of how I escaped this planet and vanquished my enemies.\r\n\r\n??Ready your weapons...??\r\n\r\nThis mission features a great variety of enemies, but when you start the game, you will be unarmed. In order to do battle, you must locate and equip a weapon. A selection of melee and firearm weapons exist across the maps. Your entity map will be a valuable asset as it allows you an aerial view of oncoming enemies so you can be prepared to strike. Collect health and ammo perks while you can, for these pickups will decrease as the levels progress making your mission all the more challenging. Let your surroundings aid your quest. Exploding barrels can be found and utilized to strategically take down enemies. Enjoy non-stop FPS action with endless battles and treacherous terrain. \r\n\r\nHow to play: Use the simple touch screen control pad to easily move, fight, select weapons and more. Kill enemies, utilize exploding barrels. Keep an eye out for hidden perks and weapons. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n-Addictive and mesmerizing maps\r\n-Efficient weapon controls and movement\r\n-Fight your way against dozens of foes\r\n-Think strategically\r\n-Interactive surroundings\r\n-Heated gun battles and ruthless snipers\r\n-Pixel style defense game\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NSNH4Q8K795","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cake Shop Bakery Story","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60445.14360153627636864.79af67c1-4435-4f95-9917-cec3b3556eb9.3caf75c5-ce02-4461-8468-48b0467519e4","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53769.14360153627636864.79af67c1-4435-4f95-9917-cec3b3556eb9.5261f32b-33d4-48ca-a0f4-e44f287d5802","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["10078NFSFuturePlayInc.CakeShopBakeryStory_yg5v0zseztb3y"],"ContentIds":["fdee5579-d029-a371-4fc3-d3a0817383fa","c0e939b4-2d3b-3a57-adaf-108f375de285"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Make a super delicious cake in my cafe cake shop!

However, certain entities in the Energy Realm have evolved into matter-less sentient beings. The game’s kitten protagonist (a cat-shaped energy entity) and spirits are all examples of such beings. Pure energy entities can travel freely between the two realms.\r\n\r\nThe story of WENJIA thus unfolds…\r\n\r\nA forest’s longstanding tranquility is shattered by a sudden earthquake. As lava bursts forth from the ground, the mountain’s spirits find themselves surrounded by fiery death. By controlling a kitten, the player must overcome numerous obstacles in the wild to reach the burning heart of the mountain and rescue the spirits before it’s too late.\r\n\r\nCross-Realm Travels\r\n\r\nWENJIA is a 2D platform game with puzzle-solving elements. Players can freely travel between two realms, each of them with different challenges and obstacles. Players must utilize both realms’ mechanisms to reach their final goal.\r\n\r\nSoothing In-game Environment\r\n\r\nWENJIA’s exquisite hand-drawn graphics bring out both the vivid colorfulness of the Matter Realm and the fantastical strangeness of the Energy Realm. The sharp contrast between the two realms offers the players a unique visual feast.\r\n\r\nWorking with game audio talents from Russia, WENJIA’s sound team has created an immersive fantasy environment that features deep woods, eerie ruins, and raging volcanos.\r\n\r\nSimple Gameplay\r\n\r\nWENJIA’s simplified gameplay makes it easy for everyone to enjoy the game. However, the challenging level design does test the players’ reflexes and ability to strategize.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P17X7NRH9TJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Word Crossy - A crossword game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33105.14516488293559613.304c0049-b983-4880-bbe0-064640a1da70.3dfd3ec8-c5da-470e-b74f-7909fbf8d670","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63175.14516488293559613.304c0049-b983-4880-bbe0-064640a1da70.c2ff1066-80f9-4266-a401-6f18eb9548cf","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["1727Riz.WordMind_yyvbx0pk3r5fr"],"ContentIds":["0f9a8ac6-1bf1-7086-3d25-9701db764d04","856efe11-3823-a974-4bf6-8590dd44fae0","327afc01-edbd-0ad9-43ae-dbd64ac4d50a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Enjoy word games?

learning, imagination and free play. It includes 16 thoughtfully designed fun games, containing very colorful and attractive images/sounds. Kids enjoy playing these games for hours without getting bored, and at the same time learning skills, which are carefully incorporated in the design of each game. \r\n\r\nWhat makes this app special is that so many different types of games are present in a single place, which are normally found in separate different apps.\r\n\r\nGames are designed to enhance following skills:\r\n  1. Basic mathematics\r\n  2. Numbers recognition\r\n  3. Hand-eye coordination\r\n  4. Concentration\r\n  5. Visual perception\r\n  6. Vocabulary\r\n  7. Classification\r\n  8. Symmetry\r\n  9. Organizing\r\n 10. Memory\r\n 11. Matching\r\n 12.

If kid is interested more in some types of games, he/she can skip the ones he/she doesn't want.\r\n\r\nTo keep kids challenged, points are awarded for each game stage completed.

The child is given three digits and two operators and has to compose the case him/herself.\r\nWhat’s so special about it? The child visually memorizes the case itself and can see what will happen if he changes the digits. Now there is no need to scissor out paper digits. The program itself indicates whether or not your child has composed the case right.\r\n \r\n“Training” is an easy-to-handle tool for effective instruction of your child. Forget about countless slips of paper with cases written on them! Everything is right here: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. After solving the problem the results are saved and can be seen on the stats page, the graph represents the results and the number of errors. This helps to track the dynamics of learning.\r\n \r\nOnce your child has learnt to solve the cases, you won’t have to study with him. After the solving you will always be able to see the way he or she has solved it.\r\n \r\nToday there is no app with similar functionality.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDFXVX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"School of Dragons","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15266.9007199266295351.e8984498-bda3-45a6-85ca-e0f9c2521411.65ac06a1-ae8e-4f85-8c7b-375327cdbd58","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45198.9007199266295351.e8984498-bda3-45a6-85ca-e0f9c2521411.54df4feb-fda2-4a33-8021-064abf2c9249","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31331.9007199266295351.e8984498-bda3-45a6-85ca-e0f9c2521411.4e8218f1-0746-477e-9e10-e457dae68a12","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["0D86EB60.SchoolofDragons_sxb412dacz86t"],"ContentIds":["455a27f0-8e5e-39db-6255-afb876a5e3be","c5b0aae8-d973-e90e-6bf3-b2073b75c2d3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Fly fast, train hard, and learn well to become the Ultimate Dragon Trainer!

Since the time of the golden age of piracy, the locations have become neglected, deserted and overgrown with plants. Full moon, bones laying on the ground, and a skull-shaped rock add to the dark atmosphere of the mysterious island.\r\nWhat tragic events took place on the island before your arrival? What evil powers can make an old, rotting ship sail? Is the horrifying, undead pirate really as evil as he seems? \r\n\r\nYou will find answers to these questions during your trip through the ghost ship haunting the seas of the Caribbean, the grim Skull Island where pirates’ bones cover the ground, a ruined fortress ridden by cannonballs and catacombs stretching below the island’s surface. Are you strong enough to save your daughter? Will you dare to lift the curse?\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG7H2","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spirit of Wandering - The Legend HD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.63144.9007199266303223.477aa454-a7e8-4fd3-a467-26d7bf7cf2bf.597b1996-e02b-432c-b633-3372ef2855fa","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.12564.9007199266303223.4dc5f019-43fe-48c9-ac9c-03bd848b777d.1af7eacd-918c-4bc7-a1e2-424642872930","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.23022.9007199266303223.bf63e895-9d9f-46cf-a7c5-70b5a6f1664c.80ef55c6-a559-4639-a3a4-d4c22b5bc77a","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.8277.9007199266303223.56b6623e-6a7e-4d56-97c4-e9da5c4d6d2e.a7c6fc10-8c65-45b4-a1db-46fa1105c31f","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.27946.9007199266303223.7b3c2114-f941-4ce4-8abe-fae341516c8e.35efa978-1f95-4efb-9585-f0abd03e85aa","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.599.9007199266303223.ce3159ce-b425-40ec-b0b9-6b3d52b0d557.f17a7840-d329-405e-9d59-09183c09da26","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.SpiritofWandering-TheLegend_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["870fa6da-8001-4847-35e8-9c00113bc5b5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Sail the seas with a pirate captain in search of her missing love in this adventurous, hidden-object quest! \r\nAfter an attack by the Flying Dutchman, the crew of the Spirit of Wandering and captain’s companion, Jack, were imprisoned in the spirit world.

The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode.

An early variant of Tic-tac-toe was played in Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called Terni Lapilli and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. However, there is some evidence to suggest that Tic-Tac-Toe could originate back to ancient Egypt. \r\nThe different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to \"noughts and crosses\", the British name, appeared in 1864. The first print reference to a game called \"tick-tack-toe\" occurred in 1884, but referred to \"a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored\". \"Tic-tac-toe\" may also derive from \"tick-tack\", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of noughts and crosses as tic-tac-toe occurred in the 20th century. \r\nWhen playing against a phone, human player is always 'O'.

Each picture is related to an English\r\nword that starts with the letter on the door. The English word is also shown\r\nin outline form so each letter of the word can also be filled in and colored as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nOnce you are done coloring a picture you can return to the village where it\r\nwill congratulate you with one of several happy phrases and then you are\r\nautomatically moved through the village to the next house.
